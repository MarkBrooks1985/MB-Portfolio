# <Mark Brooks Portfolio>

## Description

This project was our second challenge for coding boot camp. For it we had code from scratch a portfolio page with only an example to work from. We where told we did not have to make it exactly the same but I admit I did like the rough layout from the example and stuck with a similar layout and gave it my own flair.

## Directory path for Images and CSS

The path I am using sticks to the format most of our work is working with. Thus the whole Assests -> Images/CSS

## Credits

I claim no credit for the images I am using other then the one of my own face, I simply found them on google. Also the contact me form was inspired by one I found on the WS3 site with some styling differences.
